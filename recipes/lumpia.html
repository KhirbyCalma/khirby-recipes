        <p>
            Lumpia is a traditional Filipino recipe for lumpia, or fried spring rolls.
            They're made with paper-thin lumpia wrappers and filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, cabbage, and other vegetables. 
            Serve lumpia as a side dish or appetizer with a sweet chili dipping sauce.
