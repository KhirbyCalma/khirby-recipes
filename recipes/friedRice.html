                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Fried rice has been a kitchen staple since as early as the Sui Dynasty (589â€“618 CE) in China. 
                    The primary reason for the continued popularity and ubiquity of this dish comes down to two 
                    things: its adaptability and the fact that people almost always cook too much rice to eat in one sitting.

                        <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced, white and green parts divided</li>
                        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                        <li>1 tbsp. peeled and minced ginger (from a 1" piece)</li>
                        <li>4 c. cooked long grain rice (preferably leftover)</li>
                        <li>3/4 c. frozen peas</li>
                        <li>3 tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce </li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 2 minutes. 
                            Add 1 tablespoon oil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Beat egg with 2 teaspoons water and a large pinch salt and add to skillet. 
                            Cook, stirring to form large soft curds, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Return skillet to high heat and add 2 tablespoons oil, the carrots, and whites of the green onions. 
                            Cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, 
                            stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add rice, peas, and cooked eggs to skillet. Pour in soy sauce and cook, stirring until heated through, 
                            1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the remaining green onions.
                        </li>
